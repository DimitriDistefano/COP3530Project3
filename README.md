# COP3530Project3
With increased carbon dioxide emissions, comes a rising concern in global warming and the approach of mass human extinction. Project 3 is an application aimed to provide a rough prediction of how many years until human extinction.

## Description
Project 3, the Mass Extinction Calculator, provides an interface for users to see the years until extinction based upon current carbon dioxide emissions. The interface lays out the carbon dioxide emissions of the top 12 countries in the world with the ability for the user to increase emission percentage and population size. 

The key features of this project include:
* **Graphical Interface:** The interface allows users to see a visual representation displaying years until extinction and easily adjustable counters for emission and population size by country.

* **Country Specific data:** One of the functionalities allows users to see a country's carbon dioxide emission within a specific month and year.

* **Search Functionality:** The application incorporates a functionality for users to easily search the first date that the Earth has hit a desired temperature.
