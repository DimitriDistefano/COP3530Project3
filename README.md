# COP3530Project3

With increased carbon dioxide emissions(CO2), comes a rising concern in global warming and the approach of mass human extinction. Project 3 is an application aimed to provide a rough prediction of how many years until human extinction based upon population size and CO2 emissions.

## Description

Project 3, the Mass Extinction Calculator, provides an interface for users to see the years until extinction based upon current CO2 emissions. The interface lays out the CO2 emissions of the top 12 countries in the world with the ability for the user to increase emission percentage and population size. 

The key features of this project include:
* **Graphical Interface:** The interface allows users to see a visual representation displaying years until extinction and easily adjustable counters for emission and population size by country.

* **Country Specific data:** One of the functionalities allows users to see a country's CO2 emission within a specific month and year.

* **Search Functionality:** The application incorporates a functionality for users to easily search the first date that the Earth has hit a desired temperature.

# Installation ðŸ’»

To use the Mass Extinction Calculator, follow these installation steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/COP3530Project3.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd COP3530Project3/
```
3. Execute Main.cpp
```bash
g++ -o <desired-out-filename> main.cpp
./main
```
5. Once the application is running, there should be a working interface similar to below:
